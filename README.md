# Python_TestDrivenDevelopment

The following function definitions are empty, but they all contain
real unit tests (in the form of Doctests) that you can run as
demonstrated.

Your task is to use the descriptive documentation and example behaviors
shown in Doctests to understand what the functions are supposed to do
and then write the code for the functions to work properly so all the
existing tests succeed.
